## Introduction 

Modern weather and climate services increasingly focus on impact-based
forecasts (what will the weather do rather than what it will be).  Impact-based forecasting (IBF) has emerged as a crucial
tool in disaster preparedness and risk reduction. Along with
that shift comes the need to measure how well those forecasts support the
real-world decisions of stakeholders (emergency managers, policy makers,
private sector, etc.). However, traditional
verification methods, focused primarily on forecast statistical accuracy, may not
fully capture the value and effectiveness of these forecasts. This post
explores why we need to move beyond conventional verification approaches and
embrace a decision-centric verification framework.

Traditional weather forecast verification often focuses too heavily on model
accuracy metrics (like RMSE, bias scores, etc.) rather than the ultimate goal -
improving decisions. It asks: “How good was the forecast compared to what
actually happened?”. A forecast with slightly lower accuracy but better
calibrated to decision thresholds might actually be more valuable.  Instead of
asking "Was the forecast accurate?", we might ask "Did this forecast lead to
better decisions?" or "What prediction errors most affected decision quality?"
Conventional verification would miss this success. Decision-centric (or impact-based) verification emphasizes
outcomes for real-world decisions. It asks: “Did the forecast prompt the right
decisions (e.g., evacuation, resource allocation) that minimized negative
impacts or enhanced positive outcomes?”


## Background

Traditional weather and hazard forecast verification faces several challenges when applied to impact-based forecasting:

1. Complexity in obtaining detailed impact data for validation
2. Difficulty in quantifying the relationship between forecast accuracy and actual outcomes
3. Limited ability to capture the effectiveness of resulting decisions and actions
4. Focus on model performance rather than practical utility

1. **Antcipatoacy Action Literature**: Multiple publication on applicaiton of weather/hazard forcast for anticiaptory action where the forecast verification is directed towards decision support

2. **Knowledge Representation and Reasoning**: Provides formal structures for capturing complex relationships between forecasts, impacts, decisions, and outcomes. This helps in understanding and improving the entire forecast-to-action chain.

3. **Bayesian Philosophy**: Offers a framework for handling uncertainty and updating beliefs based on evidence, crucial for both impact prediction and decision-making.

4. **Active Inference/Free Energy Principle**: Systems work to minimize prediction errors by updating their internal models. In the context of impact forecasting, this means continuously learning from both successful and unsuccessful decisions to improve future predictions and actions.
