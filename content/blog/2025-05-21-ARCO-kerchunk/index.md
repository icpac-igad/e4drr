## ARCO and Kerchunk

Kerchunk enables efficient access to large weather datasets stored in traditional formats (GRIB2, NetCDF) by creating lightweight reference files that allow cloud-native access patterns. This approach transforms existing archives into Analysis Ready Cloud Optimized (ARCO) datasets without data duplication, significantly accelerating early warning system workflows that require rapid access to forecast and observation data.
