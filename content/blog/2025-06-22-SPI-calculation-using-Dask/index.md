The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is a widely used drought indicator that quantifies precipitation anomalies over different time scales. This workflow demonstrates computing SPI-3 for East Africa using CHIRPS rainfall data. We leverage xclim for the statistical calculations and Dask for distributed parallel processing, enabling efficient handling of large climate datasets across multiple time periods.
