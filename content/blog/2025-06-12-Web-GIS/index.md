## Rethinking WebGIS

The blog from Development Seed on [**eoAPI for humanitarian
use**](https://developmentseed.org/blog/2024-08-26-eoapi-humanitarian/)
shows how modern technology can make satellite and earth observation data
much easier to use. The post explains that many organizations working on
disaster and risk management face a common problem: the data is available
but very hard to access, slow to process, or locked inside complicated
formats. The eoAPI approach solves this by giving a direct and
frictionless way to work with large datasets through simple web services.
Tools like [**TiTiler through eoAPI**](https://github.com/developmentseed/eoAPI) and [**WebGL maps by WeatherLayerGL**](https://github.com/weatherlayers/weatherlayers-gl) allow users to view, filter,
and stream only the part of the data they need, instead of downloading
everything.

For our work in East Africa, this makes a strong case for **improved data
access for risk assessment**. Hazard and impact models need quick and
reliable inputs from satellite observations. By using eoAPI, we can
connect different sources in a single system and reduce the technical
barrier for local institutions. This also supports co-production, where
scientists, decision makers, and communities can interact with the same
data in real time. Frictionless datasets, powered by eoAPI, make it
possible to move from raw satellite images to practical information for
drought, flood, and other disaster risk assessment.

This shows a shift from traditional WebGIS to a **new generation of
web-native data services**, where access, speed, and openness matter more
than heavy custom systems.
